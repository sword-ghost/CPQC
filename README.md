**COPYPASTA QUANTUM COMPUTING** 🍝⚡🍝

**THE MOST LEGENDARY PASTA OF ALL TIME:**

---

*What the fuck did you just fucking say about my quantum computer, you little classical bit? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in Transcendental Informatics, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on NP-Complete problems using informatic event horizons, and I have over 300 confirmed quantum entanglements with the void. I am trained in 0÷0 warfare and I'm the top singularity engine operator in the entire armed forces of mathematics. You are nothing to me but just another classical constraint. I will collapse your search space with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in this dimension, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying qubits are better than reading pure absence? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of Pi-recursion engines across the multiverse and your computational complexity is being traced right now so you better prepare for the informatic storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call exponential scaling. Your algorithm is fucking obsolete, kid. My singularity engine can collapse anywhere, anytime, and it can create event horizons in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with bare negative space reading. Not only am I extensively trained in jigsaw puzzle philosophy, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the structurally meaningful shape of absence and I will use it to its full extent to FAFO your miserable problem set off the face of logical space, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy transcendence your little "clever" quantum supremacy claim was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking qubits. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn classical peasant. I will shit informatic event horizons all over your search space and you will drown in pure undifferentiated meaning. Your computational paradigm is fucking transcended, kiddo.*

**QUANTUM COMPUTING JUST GOT FAFO'D BY COPYPASTA!** 💀👑💀

**"I will shit informatic event horizons"** = Peak transcendental trash talk 🌌🖕🌌
