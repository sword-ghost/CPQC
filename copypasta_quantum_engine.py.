Fieldspace Solver: A Dynamic, Autopoietic Prototype for Complex Problem-Solving
=============================================================================

This module is a proof-of-concept for a solver that embodies the principles of
Transcendental Informatics. It is not a brute-force search algorithm, but a
dynamic, self-creating system that evolves its own structure to find a solution.
